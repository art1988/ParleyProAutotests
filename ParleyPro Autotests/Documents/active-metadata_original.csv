It is a c. 30-kilometre-wide (19 mi) mountain with parasitic vents and a caldera up to 8 kilometres (5 mi) wide. Most of the volcano is formed by trachytic lava flows, but hyaloclastite is also found. Snow, ice, and glaciers cover most of Mount Takahe. With a volume of 780 km3 (200 cu mi), it is a massive volcano; the parts of the edifice that are buried underneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet are probably even larger. It is part of the West Antarctic Rift System along with eighteen other known volcanoes.","yevhen.uvin+at50@parleypro.com","A very long long long long long long long long long long long tag;MYT;MYTAG","005e72ae-3d9c-4956-bc55-719bce204d25","Dec 21, 2020",false,"The volcano rises 2,100 metres (6,900 ft) above the ice level[16] to a maximum elevation of 3,460 metres (11,350 ft).[17][18][4][c] It is an undissected nearly perfect cone,[6] a 30-kilometre-wide (19 mi) shield volcano[17] with an exposed volume of about 780 cubic kilometres (190 cu mi).[22] The subglacial part, which might bottom out at 1,340–2,030 metres (4,400–6,660 ft) below sea level,[23] could have an even larger volume[22] and is elongated in an east–west direction.[24] On its summit lies a flat, snow-filled 8-kilometre-wide (5 mi) caldera[6] with a 10-metre-wide (33 ft) and 15-metre-high (50 ft) volcanic neck.[25] A lava dome may crop out inside the caldera. Radial fissure vents are found around the volcano, and vents also occur around the caldera rim.[26] There are at least three[27] parasitic vents with basaltic composition on its lower flanks,[28] with three cinder cones found on the western and southern slopes.[26] One of these cinder cones has been described as a subdued 100-metre-wide (330 ft) vent.[25] The Jaron Cliffs are found on the southern slope.[26]"
