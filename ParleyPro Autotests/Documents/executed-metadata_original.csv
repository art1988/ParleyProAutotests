Owing to thick ice cover it is not clear whether it is currently active,[46] and there is no seismic activity. Most of the Rift lies below sea level.[48] To the south it is flanked by the Transantarctic Mountains and to the north by the volcanic province of Marie Byrd Land. Volcanic activity in Marie Byrd Land commenced about 34 million years ago, but high activity began 14 million years ago.[49] A major uplifted dome, 1,200 by 500 kilometres (750 mi × 310 mi) in width, is centred on the Amundsen Sea coast and is associated with the Rift.[50]","yevhen.uvin+at50@parleypro.com",,"A very long long long long long long long long long long long tag;MYT;MYTAG","cc69e147-00d6-44fc-81dd-92e6cb5b4083","Dec 21, 2020",,false,"The volcano was active in the late Quaternary.[13] Radiometric results reported in 1988 include ages of less than 360,000 years for rocks in the caldera rim and of less than 240,000 years for volcanic rocks on the flanks.[67] In his 1990 book ""Volcanoes of the Antarctic Plate and Southern Oceans"" LeMasurier gave 310,000±90,000 years old as the oldest date for samples tested, citing unpublished K-Ar dates,[13] but in a 2016 review of dates for Mount Takahe LeMasurier reported that none were older than 192,000 years.[15] A 2013 paper also by LeMasurier reported maximum ages of 192,000 years for caldera rim rocks and of 66,000 years for lower flank rocks.[23] The entire volcano may have formed in less than 400,000 years[68] or even less than 200,000 years, which would imply a fast growth of the edifice.[23] 192,000±6,300 years-old rocks are found at the summit caldera, implying that the volcano had reached its present-day height by then.[69]

Early research indicated that most of Mount Takahe formed underneath the ice, but more detailed field studies concluded that most of the volcano developed above the ice surface.[31] The ice surface has fluctuated over the life of Mount Takahe, explaining why units originally emplaced under ice or water now lie above the ice surface[35] and alternate with lava flow deposits.[6] These elevated deposits were emplaced about 29,000–12,000 years ago[70] while the lava delta-like deposits are between about 70,000 and 15,000 years old.[71] After it grew out of the ice, Mount Takahe increased in size through the emission of lava flows with occasional pyroclastic eruptions.[72] Outcrops in the summit region indicate that most eruptions were magmatic, but some hydromagmatic activity occurred.[35] Cinder cones and tuff cones formed during the late stage of activity.[4]",,,"0 month",false,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
